# we will now know about mutable and immutable.

# mostly you will find that someone is relating constant and variable, which is completely wrong.

# some says u can't change is immutable and change is called mutable.

# But nothing exactly clear. So, lets check it out what is it.

example of mutable is list,dictionary and immutable are interger, string etc.

#open your python shell and write these commands.

x = 10
y = x

then see the value x and y.
you can see both come out to be 10.

in next line , write x = 15
then see the value of y, you will see y is still equall to 10.

# basically python treat everything as objects, and didn't change the reference.

so, in this case y is still pointing to the 10 , where as x now pointing to new reference that is 15.


Draw the diagram by your own to see practically. its wonderful to see/

Even if you write ie,
user = "Titan"
and see the user result, u will see its Titan
and when you again write user = "Electrical"
and see the user result, u will see its Electrical// this doesn't verify that strings are immutable.
because anyone can say it can be change after seeing this example. but as we discuss earlier python 
take everything as object and give them a reference or memory. so in this case it is showing two differnt
reference.
