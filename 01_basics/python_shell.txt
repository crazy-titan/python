# I work on python shell on my mac using the command python3 + Enter

# here we saw how to check directory
# using the command import os and then os.getcwd() , this will give your current dir.

# we also saw how to check system
# using the command import sys and then sys.platform , this will give your system mine 'darwin'

# then i saw the for loop
# for i in "chai"
...  indentation print(i)

// this will give you c,h,a, and i .

than i come to python shell again and import hello
# and then excute the function by writting hello.chai("hello world"), This will output hello world

# after this we go to hello.py file and initialise some variable.


#now i tried to access the new variable using same previous cmd hello.chai_one, but unfortunetely can't 
able to do that because the new variable is added but i didn't import them . so we need to import again

# to do this, we use libraries, from importlib import reload
and then use reload() 
# this will reload the hello file and then we can use previous cmd like , hello.chai_one and now it
will give output
