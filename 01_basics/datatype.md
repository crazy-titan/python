# Data-type / Object type

- Number: 1234, 3 + 2j , etc
- string: 'spam',"hello's" // both single and double quote accepted.
- list: collection of datatypes, any type of data you can store here.[ true, 1, 'hello']
- tuple: (1,2,3) // paranthesis is the representation
- Dictionary: its key value pair, represented using curly bracket. {'king': 'titan'}
- set: it contain unique values , no duplicate 
- boolean: true and false
- functions
- class
- Advance topics we will see

## now open the python shell and use some command to see what happpening.

~ python3
~String

~ username = "titan"
~ we can use string as array but you can't manupulate it becz its immutable.
~ username[1] will output as 'i'
~ but if you try username[1] = "k" >> it will show error.
~ username[1:3] , will give 'ita' as output


~Number
~ 2 ** 100 will easily gets calculated

~import math
~ math.pi will give you value of pi

~math.choice([]) here you can put any array inside it to get random choice from it.

~import random
~random.random() will output a random value.


~List ==> starts with zero

~ username = [1,3,5,'hello']
~ username[1] will give 3
~ username[-1] will give 'hello'
~ len(username) this will give the length of array , we can use it everywhere when required.
~ username[0:2] this will give 1,3 as output because it start from 0 and not include 2nd index.



~Dictionary ==> you can start from anywhere.

~ username = {"key":"value","king":"titan"}
~ username["key"] will output "value" 


~tuple 

~ username = (1,3,5)
~ username[1] will output as 3.

` these are the topics overview that we gona learn next `
